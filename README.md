# MITRE ATT&CK Threat Hunting

This repository introduces **MITRE ATT&CK–based threat hunting**, a proactive approach to detecting hidden threats by mapping adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to your environment. It is intended for analysts and defenders who want a practical starting point for building repeatable, hypothesis‑driven hunts using the ATT&CK framework.
